  LLVM-Binding
================
This directory contains an implementation of LLVM-Python binding using SWIG for generating the "glue". The binding only extracts the minimum amount of features 
from the LLVM to support Pymothoa.

---------
  Build
---------

Unless you have modified the source code, you do not need to re-generate the
SWIG "glue."

Run 'make all' in this directory. This invokes scripts to generate the SWIG "glue" from the llvm_wrapper.hpp. Re-build everytime the llvm_wrapper.hpp is changed.
